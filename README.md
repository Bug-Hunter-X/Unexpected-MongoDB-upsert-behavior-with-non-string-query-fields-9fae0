# Unexpected MongoDB Upsert Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with MongoDB's `updateOne` method with the `upsert: true` option.  The problem occurs when the query field is not a simple string but a nested object. The query fails to find the matching document, leading to an incorrect insertion instead of an update.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.js` file contains a JavaScript code snippet illustrating the issue. The `updateOne` operation attempts to upsert a document, but due to the structure of the `name` field, the query fails, resulting in the insertion of a new document instead of updating an existing one.

## Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses the problem by explicitly handling the potential for nested objects in the query.  By properly structuring the query to match the actual document structure, the `updateOne` operation will correctly identify and update the existing document.
