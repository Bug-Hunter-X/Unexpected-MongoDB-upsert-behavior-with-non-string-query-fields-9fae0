```javascript
const query = { name: 'John Doe' };
const update = { $set: { age: 30 } };

db.collection('users').updateOne(query, update, { upsert: true });
```
This code snippet attempts to upsert a document.  The issue arises when the `name` field in the `users` collection is not a string but an object, leading to an unexpected result.  The query would fail to find the document even though an object with `name` as a key might exist, resulting in a new document being inserted instead of updating an existing one. This is an uncommon error as it relies on an implicit type assumption.
